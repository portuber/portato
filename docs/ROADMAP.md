# `portato` — Roadmap

> The summary state of all phases. The statuses are mirrored in the phase files and must match.
> For the rules on statuses and sequencing see [`CONVENTIONS.md`](./CONVENTIONS.md).
> For the technical specification see [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md).

Legend: `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

## Rules (quick summary)

1. **Sequencing:** phase N does not start until every phase in its `depends_on` is `[x]`.
2. **Parallelism:** at most **one** phase may be in work (`[~]`) at a time.
3. **Definition of Done:** every "Definition of Done" item in the phase file must be `[x]` before the phase status becomes `[x]`.
4. **Who moves statuses:** the human says "start phase N" / "complete phase N"; the agent verifies the conditions and edits the phase file + this table.
5. **Level of detail:** phases 0–6 (MVP) are described in detail; phases 7–11 (post-MVP) are outline only, filled in when reached.

## Current focus

**MVP complete (Phases 0–6).** All six MVP phases are `[x]`: config, native-SSH
forwarding, standalone TUI, the daemon with HTTP-over-unix-socket IPC, the CLI
+ smart launcher + background hand-off, and system autostart
(`portato install/uninstall` via launchd / systemd --user).

Phase 6 was closed by an explicit maintainer decision; the runtime-verified
parts are `install`/`list`/`uninstall` on macOS, idempotency, tunnels-off by
default, and clean vet/gofmt/cross-compilation. The reboot/relogin survival,
Linux lingering, and the full live-traffic/auto-reconnect MVP E2E were **not**
exercised and are recorded as a deferred-verification deviation in
[phase-6-autostart-e2e.md](./phases/phase-6-autostart-e2e.md) — recommended
manual checks before relying on autostart in production.

Next up: **Phase 7 — Remote (`-R`) tunnels** (post-MVP), the first outline phase
to be refined when reached.

Phases 1–6 are the detailed MVP plan; 7–11 are outline (goal + DoD), refined as we approach them.

## Phase summary

- **Phase 0** — `go.mod`, the cobra skeleton of all subcommands (stubs), the directory tree, the Makefile.
- **Phase 1** — YAML load/save, XDG paths, `enabled` persistence, defaults, validation, unit tests.
- **Phase 2** — `Tunnel` + `Engine`: native ssh, ssh-agent + identity, TOFU known_hosts, reconnect + backoff, keepalive, `-L` only.
- **Phase 3** — `Controller` (local) + the bubbletea list, hotkeys, running in standalone mode.
- **Phase 4** — `portato daemon` (HTTP over a unix socket), `Controller` (remote), `portato attach`, the PID file, 0600 permissions.
- **Phase 5** — the CLI (`list/enable/disable/restart`), the smart launcher `portato`, the "background?" modal + hand-off to the daemon.
- **Phase 6** — `portato install/uninstall` (launchd + systemd --user), the final MVP E2E checklist.
- **Phase 7** — `type: remote` (`-R`), `ssh.Client.Listen` on the remote side.
- **Phase 8** — `type: dynamic` (`-D`), a SOCKS5 proxy.
- **Phase 9** — push events (`GET /events` SSE/chunked) instead of 1s polling.
- **Phase 10** — a tunnel editor in the TUI (`e`/`n`/`d`).
- **Phase 11** — logs in the TUI (`l`), themes, `portato doctor`, tests, CI.

## Final MVP E2E (on completing Phase 6)

1. `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` — green.
2. The config has one tunnel with `enabled: false`.
3. `portato install` -> the daemon starts on its own (launchctl/systemctl).
4. `portato list` shows the tunnel as `○ Disabled`.
5. `portato` (TUI) -> space -> `Connecting` -> `Connected`; `nc -z 127.0.0.1 <local>` succeeds, traffic flows.
6. space again -> `Disabled`, the port is closed.
7. **Hand-off:** `portato` with no daemon, space to enable the tunnel, `q`, answer `y` -> the daemon is spawned, the tunnel keeps running, `portato list` confirms it.
8. SSH server dropped -> auto-reconnect restores `Connected`.
9. After a reboot/relogin — the daemon is up, the tunnels are `Disabled`.
10. `portato uninstall` -> the service is removed cleanly.
