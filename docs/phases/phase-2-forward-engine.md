phase: 2
title: Forward engine (native SSH, local -L)
status: done
depends_on: [1]
---

## Goal

Actually forward a local port to a remote via native SSH (`golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`),
with auto-reconnect, keepalive, and a precise state machine. Only **local (-L)** in this phase.
A thread-safe `Engine` as a tunnel manager — `localController` in Phase 3 will be built on top of it.

## Phase scope (what we do)

- `Tunnel` with a state machine: `Off → Connecting → Connected → Error(msg) → Reconnecting`.
- Auth: ssh-agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) → `identity` key (`ssh.ParsePrivateKey`).
- `HostKeyCallback` via `knownhosts.New`; with `accept_new_hosts: true` — a TOFU wrapper that appends a new key.
- Data flow for local: `net.Listen(local)` → accept-loop → `sshClient.Dial("tcp", remote)` → bidirectional `io.Copy`.
- Reconnect with exponential backoff (1s→2s→…→30s max), reset after 30s of stable `Connected`.
- Keepalive `keepalive@openssh.com` every 30s.
- `Engine`: thread-safe (sync.RWMutex), `List() []Status`, `Enable(name)`, `Disable(name)`, `Restart(name)`, `Reload(cfg)`.

## Phase scope (what we do NOT do)

- Remote (-R) and dynamic (-D) — phases 7, 8.
- IPC/daemon — Phase 4.
- TUI — Phase 3 (but the Engine is ready to be used from the TUI).

## Tasks

- [x] `glm-complex/internal/forward/ssh.go`:
  - [x] `func dialSSH(ctx, t config.Tunnel, defaults config.Defaults, log *slog.Logger) (*ssh.Client, error)` (`ctx` added for responsive Stop via `net.Dialer.DialContext` + `ssh.NewClientConn`):
    - build `ssh.ClientConfig` (User, AuthMethod, HostKeyCallback, Timeout: 5s).
    - auth chain: `ssh.PublicKeysCallback` from the agent → on failure `ssh.ParsePrivateKey` + `ssh.PublicKeys` from the identity.
    - `HostKeyCallback`: `knownhosts.New(defaults.KnownHosts)`; if `defaults.AcceptNewHosts` — a wrapper that appends the key.
    - human-readable errors: `unknown host: <fingerprint>. Add to known_hosts or set accept_new_hosts: true` / `auth failed: ...` / `connect refused: ...`.
- [x] `glm-complex/internal/forward/tunnel.go` (`State`/`Status` moved to `state.go`):
  - [x] `type State int` with constants `Off, Connecting, Connected, Reconnecting, Error`.
  - [x] `type Tunnel struct` (fields per plan + `baseCtx`, `done`).
  - [x] `func NewTunnel(baseCtx, cfg, defaults, log) *Tunnel` (renamed from `New` to avoid clashing with `NewEngine`).
  - [x] `func (t *Tunnel) Start(ctx)`: open listener, launch accept-loop in a goroutine. State `Connecting` → after first success `Connected` → on error `Error` + start reconnect-loop.
  - [x] `func (t *Tunnel) Stop()`: close listener and client, state `Off` (synchronously waits for run-loop to exit → race-free `Restart`).
  - [x] `func (t *Tunnel) Restart()`: `Stop()` + `Start()`.
  - [x] `func (t *Tunnel) Status() Status` — under mutex: name/state/error/uptime.
  - [x] accept-loop: for each incoming conn — `client.Dial("tcp", remote)` + two `io.Copy` in both directions (goroutines). On `client.Dial` error — log a warning, close the incoming conn.
  - [x] reconnect-loop: on SSH drop → state `Reconnecting` → backoff (1s→2s→4s→8s→16s→30s cap) → reconnect. Reset backoff after 30s of stable `Connected`.
  - [x] keepalive-loop: every 30s `client.SendRequest("keepalive@openssh.com", true, nil)` with a 5s timeout; on error — close client, which triggers the reconnect-loop.
- [x] `glm-complex/internal/forward/engine.go`:
  - [x] `type Engine struct` + internal `tunneler` interface (for mocks in tests).
  - [x] `func NewEngine(ctx, cfg *config.Config, log *slog.Logger) *Engine` — creates tunnels from the config (but does not start them).
  - [x] `func (e *Engine) Enable(name string) error` — check existence + `Start`.
  - [x] `func (e *Engine) Disable(name string) error` — `Stop`.
  - [x] `func (e *Engine) Restart(name string) error` — `Restart`.
  - [x] `func (e *Engine) UpAll()`, `DownAll()` (used in TUI hotkeys `a`/`x`).
  - [x] `func (e *Engine) List() []Status` — snapshot under mutex, in config order.
  - [x] `func (e *Engine) Reload(cfg *config.Config)` — compare with the current set: new ones — add, missing ones — `Stop` + remove, changed ones — `Restart` (diff by connection fields, `Enabled` excluded).
  - [x] `func (e *Engine) StartEnabled()` — start all tunnels with `cfg.Enabled == true` (used by the daemon at startup).
  - [x] `func (e *Engine) StopAll()` — graceful shutdown of all tunnels.
- [x] Tests:
  - [x] `engine_test.go`: test `Enable/Disable/Restart/List/UpAll/DownAll/StartEnabled/Reload` on a fake tunnel (via the `tunneler` interface) — without real SSH.
  - [x] `tunnel_integration_test.go`: in-process `ssh.NewServer` with direct-tcpip forwarding — checks that traffic flows, auto-reconnect after “kill sshd”, and that `Disable` closes the local port.
  - [x] Backoff calculation moved to `backoff.go` `func nextBackoff(attempt int) time.Duration` — unit test.
- [x] Hidden debug command `portato forward <name>` (see `internal/cmd/forward.go`) — for manual DoD verification before the TUI in Phase 3.

## Definition of Done

- [x] `go test ./internal/forward/...` is green (engine unit tests + backoff + integration).
- [x] An enabled tunnel to a test SSH server opens a local port and proxies traffic to the remote (covered by `TestTunnelTrafficAndReconnect`: echo through the tunnel).
- [x] `Disable` closes the port (covered: after `Stop` `net.Dial` to the local port fails).
- [x] Dropping the SSH session on the server side (kill sshd) → the engine itself restores `Connected` via backoff (covered by the integration test).
- [x] Backoff resets after ~30s of stable operation (`nextAttemptAfterDisconnect`, covered by `TestNextAttemptAfterDisconnect`: below threshold → attempt grows, at/above threshold → 0).
- [x] `List()` reflects correct statuses and error texts (broken ssh target → `Error` with the reason — verified by smoke test `portato forward` against `127.0.0.1:1` → `error (connect refused: ...)`).
- [x] `Reload(cfg)` correctly adds/removes/restarts tunnels by config diff (covered by `TestEngineReload`, `TestEngineReloadDefaultsChangedRestarts`).
- [x] `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -l .` are clean.

## Verification

```sh
cd glm-complex
go test ./internal/forward/... -v

# Manual verification (needs a test SSH server, e.g. a local sshd or a container):
# 1. Bring up sshd on localhost:2222 with a test key.
# 2. Configure a tunnel in the config.
# 3. Write a temporary main or use existing one (see Phase 3):
go run ./cmd/portato attach  # not implemented yet, but you can temporarily make a debug command
# 4. After Enable — check nc -z 127.0.0.1 <local>
# 5. kill sshd → make sure in the logs that the engine reconnects
```

Full manual verification will be available after Phase 3 (TUI). In this phase, unit tests and an integration test in code are sufficient.

## Technical details

- **State machine:**
  ```
  Off --Enable()--> Connecting --ssh.Dial ok--> Connected
                                       \
                                        --ssh.Dial err--> Error
  Connected/Connecting --drop--> Reconnecting --backoff--> Connecting
  any --Disable()--> Off
  ```
- **Backoff:** exponential with jitter (optional). Cap 30s. Reset on stable `Connected` ≥ 30s.
- **Keepalive:** `keepalive@openssh.com` — the standard OpenSSH request name. The server usually replies `false` (i.e. “I don’t support it”), but it is a signal of channel liveness. On response timeout → consider the session dead.
- **TOFU wrapper:** a simple `HostKeyCallback` that, when `key == nil`, appends the key to known_hosts and returns nil. On mismatch — error. Implementation: `knownhosts.New` + a custom `HostKeyCallback`.
- **io.Copy:** use `io.Copy` in two goroutines per conn-pair; on drop of either side — close both.
- **Read/write mutex:** `List()` is called frequently from the TUI (every frame/tick); `Enable/Disable` are rare. `RWMutex` is optimal.
- **Do not introduce** abstractions for remote/dynamic — they will be added in Phase 7/8 on top of the existing code (shared SSH-client lifecycle, with only the accept/dial flow being specific).

## Phase output artifact

- The `internal/forward` package with a ready `Engine` — in Phase 3 it will be wrapped by `localController`, and in Phase 4 by `daemon`.
- Proof that a local tunnel actually proxies traffic and survives drops.
